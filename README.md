Peridynamics offers a new methodology for modelling solid mechanics problems using the idea of interactions of a point with the neigboring points and is a different framework compared to the classical continuum mechanics that is being used most widely. 

This project aims to develop a (linear?) peridynamics solver (and also constites the part of masters thesis of Gajendra supervised by PhD scholar Felix Bott at the Technical University of Munich)

The readme file will be updated on the fly as the project progresses (and we hope it does  evolve to something useful and different and probably better than what already exists out there;) )
